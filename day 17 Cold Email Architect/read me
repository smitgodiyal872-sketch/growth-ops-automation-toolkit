# 📧 Cold Email Architect (AI Sales Engineer)

**Architected by Smit Godiyal**

An AI-powered sales agent that generates high-converting, multi-touch drip campaigns (3-step sequences) based on proven copywriting frameworks like PAS and AIDA. It replaces generic templates with hyper-personalized outreach.

## 🛑 The Problem
Most cold outreach fails because of "Blank Screen Syndrome" and generic copy.
* **The Volume Trap:** Founders send 1,000 generic emails and get 0 replies.
* **The Follow-Up Failure:** Most people send one email and give up. Statistics show 80% of sales happen on the 5th follow-up.
* **The Tone Mismatch:** Engineers write emails that sound like robots; Salespeople write emails that sound like spam.

## 🛠️ The Solution
I built a **Cold Email Architect** that acts as a YC Alumni Sales Mentor:
1.  **Campaign Logic:** It doesn't just write one email; it structures a full **3-Step Drip Campaign**:
    * **Day 0 (The Hook):** Low-friction value prop.
    * **Day 3 (The Nudge):** Case study or social
