# 🎨 Viral Carousel Generator (AI Design Engine)

**Architected by Smit Godiyal**

An automated content engine that turns a single topic into a professionally designed, 5-slide LinkedIn/Instagram carousel in seconds. It combines **Generative AI** for viral hook writing with **Python Image Processing** for pixel-perfect design.

## 🛑 The Problem
Personal branding is essential, but high-quality content is a bottleneck.
* **The Time Sink:** Designing a carousel in Canva takes 1-2 hours.
* **The Cost:** Hiring a designer or ghostwriter costs $500/month.
* **The Friction:** Most people have ideas but struggle with "making it look good."

## 🛠️ The Solution
I built a **Carousel Engine** that acts as an AI Design Agency:
1.  **Content Strategy:** Uses Google Gemini 1.5 to write viral hooks, restructure ideas into 5 slides, and generate punchy copy.
2.  **Automated Design:** Uses Python's `Pillow` (PIL) library to programmatically draw text, shapes, and layouts.
3.  **Smart Typography:** Solves common Python font rendering issues by integrating directly with the Windows System Fonts for crisp, high-resolution text.

## ⚙️ The Stack
* **Frontend:** Streamlit
* **Intelligence:** Google Gemini 1.5 Flash
* **Image Processing:** Python Pillow (PIL)
* **Design
