# 🚀 Content Ops Engine (AI Agent)

**Architected by Smit Godiyal**

A "Founder Mode" tool that replaces the need for a ghostwriter. It uses **Google's Gemini Pro/Flash** to instantly transform raw brain dumps into viral distribution assets for LinkedIn and Twitter.

## 🛑 The Problem
Founders need distribution, but writing takes too long.
* **Ghostwriters** are expensive ($2k/mo).
* **Manual writing** burns valuable executive hours.
* **Generic AI** (ChatGPT) sounds like a robot.

## 🛠️ The Solution
I built a custom **Content Ops Engine** in Python that:
1.  **Ingests Raw Context:** Takes messy notes, code snippets, or voice transcripts.
2.  **Injects "Viral DNA":** Uses prompt engineering to format hooks, formatting, and CTAs.
3.  **Multi-Platform Output:** Generates a LinkedIn Post and a Twitter Thread simultaneously.
4.  **Auto-Detects Models:** Dynamically scans the user's API key to find the fastest available Gemini model (Flash vs. Pro).

## ⚙️ The Stack
* **Frontend:** Streamlit
* **Intelligence:** Google Gemini API (1.5 Flash / Pro)
* **Language:** Python 3.10+
