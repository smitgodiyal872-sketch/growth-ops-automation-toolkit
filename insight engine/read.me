# 📊 Insight Engine (AI Data Analyst)

**Architected by Smit Godiyal**

A "Code Interpreter" for your spreadsheet data. This tool turns raw CSV/Excel files into interactive charts by writing and executing Python code in real-time. Built for the Founder's Office to replace manual Excel reporting with instant conversation.

## 🛑 The Problem
Business data is trapped in static CSVs and Excel sheets.
* **The Latency:** Founders ask "What's the revenue trend?" and wait 2 days for an analyst to build a deck.
* **The Friction:** Excel charts are clunky and hard to update.
* **The Skill Gap:** Non-technical stakeholders can't write SQL or Python to query their own data.

## 🛠️ The Solution
I built an **Insight Engine** that acts as an on-demand Data Scientist:
1.  **Ingestion:** Instantly loads CSV or Excel files into a Pandas DataFrame.
2.  **Code Generation:** Translates plain English queries (e.g., *"Show me a pie chart of sales by region"*) into executable Python/Plotly code using Google Gemini.
3.  **Execution:** Safely runs the code in a sandbox to render interactive, zoomable charts instantly.

## ⚙️ The Stack
* **Frontend:** Streamlit
* **Intelligence:** Google Gemini 1.5 Flash (Logic & Code Gen)
* **Data Processing:** Pandas (Python Data Analysis Library)
* **Visualization:** Plotly Express (Interactive Graphing)
