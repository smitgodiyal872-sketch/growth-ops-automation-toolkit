# 📄 DocuMind (AI Document Intelligence)

**Architected by Smit Godiyal**

An AI-powered document analysis engine that allows users to "chat" with their PDF files. It uses **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** to ingest complex documents (contracts, research papers, financial reports) and allows users to query them using natural language.

## 🛑 The Problem
Static documents are dead data.
* **The Search Gap:** Ctrl+F only finds keywords, not meaning. You can't Ctrl+F "What are the risks in this contract?"
* **The Context Limit:** Humans cannot hold 50 pages of legal text in working memory at once.
* **The Speed Bump:** Manually reviewing a 100-page operational report takes hours.

## 🛠️ The Solution
I built **DocuMind**, a semantic analysis engine:
1.  **Ingestion:** Uses `pypdf` to extract raw text from unstructured PDF blobs.
2.  **Context Injection:** Feeds the document content
