# 🎙️ Voice Ops Agent (Voice-to-CRM)

**Architected by Smit Godiyal**

A "Founder Mode" tool that eliminates manual CRM data entry. It uses **Google Gemini 1.5 Flash (Multimodal)** to listen to raw voice notes, extract structured lead data, and auto-draft follow-up emails instantly.

## 🛑 The Problem
Founders meet 10+ people a day but fail to track them because manual data entry is high-friction.
* **Lost Network:** forgetting to add leads to HubSpot/Notion.
* **Slow Follow-ups:** "I'll email them later" turns into "never."
* **Data Decay:** Context is lost if not recorded immediately.

## 🛠️ The Solution
I built a **Voice-to-CRM Bridge** in Python that acts as an "AI Chief of Staff":
1.  **Native Listening:** Uses Gemini 1.5's multimodal capabilities to "hear" audio files directly (no whisper transcription needed).
2.  **Structured Extraction:** Converts messy rants into clean JSON (Name, Role, Company, Action Items).
3.  **Auto-Drafting:** Writes a context-aware follow-up email ready to send.

## ⚙️ The Stack
* **Frontend:** Streamlit (v1.40+ for Audio Input)
* **Intelligence:** Google Gemini 1.5 Flash (Multimodal Audio Processing)
* **Language:** Python 3.10+
