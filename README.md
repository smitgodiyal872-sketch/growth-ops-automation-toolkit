# Growth Ops Automation Toolkit ⚡️
A collection of Python scripts, Excel models, and no-code tools to automate marketing and revenue operations.

A repository of tools built during my #100DaysOfGrowthOps challenge.
**Goal:** Bridge the gap between Technical Execution (Python/SQL) and Business Strategy (MBA).

## 🛠️ The Tools

### Day 01: YouTube Revenue Forecaster (Python)
* **Problem:** Manually estimating creator revenue takes hours of spreadsheet work.
* **Solution:** A Python script that hits the YouTube Data API, pulls subscriber counts, and applies a conversion logic to estimate ARR.
* **Tech Stack:** Python, Google API, Pandas.

### Day 02: Startup Deal Flow Scorer (Excel System)
* **Problem:** VC/Accelerators drown in noise. Hard to filter top 1% of startups.
* **Solution:** An automated scoring model that ranks startups based on TVL, Team Size, and Growth %.
* **Features:** Weighted Scoring (0-10), Conditional Formatting (Red/Green flags).
